# Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this example, we will demonstrate how to fit and score an unsupervised learning model with a [sample of Landsat 8 data](https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/tree/develop/pyrasterframes/src/test/resources).

## Imports and Data Preparation

```python, setup, echo=False
from IPython.core.display import display
import pyrasterframes.rf_ipython
from pyrasterframes.utils import create_rf_spark_session

import os

spark = create_rf_spark_session()

```

We import various Spark components needed to construct our `Pipeline`.

```python, imports, echo=True
import pandas as pd
from pyrasterframes import TileExploder
from pyrasterframes.rasterfunctions import rf_assemble_tile, rf_crs, rf_extent, rf_tile, rf_dimensions

from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

```

The first step is to create a Spark DataFrame of our imagery data. To achieve that we will create a catalog DataFrame using the pattern from [the I/O page](raster-io.html#Single-Scene--Multiple-Bands). In the catalog, each row represents a distinct area and time, and each column is the URI to a band's image product. The resulting Spark DataFrame may have many rows per URI, with a column corresponding to each band.


```python, catalog
filenamePattern = "https://github.com/locationtech/rasterframes/" \
                  "raw/develop/core/src/test/resources/L8-B{}-Elkton-VA.tiff"
catalog_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {'b' + str(b): filenamePattern.format(b) for b in range(1, 8)}
])

df = spark.read.raster(catalog_df, catalog_col_names=catalog_df.columns)
df = df.withColumn('crs', rf_crs(df.b1)) \
       .withColumn('extent', rf_crs(df.b1))
df.printSchema()
```

## Create ML Pipeline

SparkML requires that each observation be in its own row, and features for each observation be packed into a single `Vector`. For this unsupervised learning problem, we will treat each _pixel_ as an observation and each band as a feature. The first step is to "explode" the _tiles_ into a single row per pixel. In RasterFrames, generally a pixel is called a @ref:[`cell`](concepts.md#cell).

```python, exploder
exploder = TileExploder()
```

To "vectorize" the the band columns, we use the SparkML `VectorAssembler`. Each of the seven bands is a different feature.

```python, assembler
assembler = VectorAssembler() \
    .setInputCols(list(catalog_df.columns)) \
    .setOutputCol("features")
```

For this problem, we will use the K-means clustering algorithm and configure our model to have 5 clusters.

```python, kmeans
kmeans = KMeans().setK(5).setFeaturesCol('features')
```

We can combine the above stages into a single [`Pipeline`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html).

```python, pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline().setStages([exploder, assembler, kmeans])
```

## Fit the Model and Score

Fitting the _pipeline_ actually executes exploding the _tiles_, assembling the features _vectors_, and fitting the K-means clustering model.

```python, fit
model = pipeline.fit(df)
```

We can use the `transform` function to score the training data in the fitted _pipeline_ model. This will add a column called `prediction` with the closest cluster identifier.

```python, transform
clustered = model.transform(df)
```

Now let's take a look at some sample output.

```python, view_predictions
clustered.select('prediction', 'extent', 'column_index', 'row_index', 'features')
```

If we want to inspect the model statistics, the SparkML API requires us to go through this unfortunate contortion to access the clustering results:

```python, cluster_stats
cluster_stage = model.stages[2]
```

We can then compute the sum of squared distances of points to their nearest center, which is elemental to most cluster quality metrics.

```python, distance
metric = cluster_stage.computeCost(clustered)
print("Within set sum of squared errors: %s" % metric)
```

## Visualize Prediction

We can recreate the tiled data structure using the metadata added by the `TileExploder` pipeline stage.

```python, assemble
from pyrasterframes.rf_types import CellType

tile_dims = df.select(rf_dimensions(df.b1).alias('dims')).first()['dims']
retiled = clustered.groupBy('extent', 'crs') \
    .agg(
        rf_assemble_tile('column_index', 'row_index', 'prediction',
            tile_dims['cols'], tile_dims['rows'], CellType.int8()).alias('prediction')
)

retiled.printSchema()
```

```python, display
retiled
```

The resulting output is shown below.

```python, viz
display(retiled.select('prediction').first()['prediction'])
```
