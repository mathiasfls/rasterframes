# RasterFrames

RasterFramesÂ® brings together Earth-observation (EO) data access, cloud computing, and DataFrame-based data science. The recent explosion of EO data from public and private satellite operators presents both a huge opportunity and a huge challenge to the data analysis community. It is _Big Data_ in the truest sense, and its footprint is rapidly getting bigger. 

RasterFrames provides a DataFrame-centric view over arbitrary raster data, enabling spatiotemporal queries, map algebra raster operations, and compatibility with the ecosystem of Spark ML algorithms. By using DataFrames as the core cognitive and compute data model, it is able to deliver these features in a form that is both accessible to general analysts and scalable along with the rapidly growing data footprint.
