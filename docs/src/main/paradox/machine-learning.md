# Machine Learning

RasterFrames provides facilities to train and predict with a wide variety of machine learning models through [Spark ML Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html). This library provides a variety of pipeline components for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and data preparation that can be used to represent and repeatably conduct a variety of tasks in machine learning.

The following sections provide some examples on how to integrate these workflows with RasterFrames.
